My personal website which features my profile, skills and projects. 
This website uses the Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat), as well as adapts from the 
[Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) theme. This template features various content sections and a Google Maps section with a custom map marker.
